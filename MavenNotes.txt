What is Maven 
2 ------------- 
3 
 
4 At its simplest, Maven is a build tool 
5  - It always produces one artifact(component) 
6  - It helps us manage dependencies 
7 
 
8 It can also be used as a project management tool 
9  - It handles versioning and releases 
10  - Describes what your project is doing or what it produces 
11  - Can easily produce javadocs as well as other site information 
12 
 
13 Who owns it 
14 ----------- 
15 -Maven is managed by the Apache Software Foundation 
16 -Maven sites are built with Maven 
17 -open source 
18 
 
19 Why do you want to use it 
20 ------------------------- 
21 -Repeatable builds 
22  we can recreate our build for any enviornment(DevOps,WebOps...) 
23 -Transitive dependencies 
24  downloading a dependency will also pull other items it needs 
25 -contains everything it needs for your environment 
26 -works with a localrepo 
27 -works with your IDE, but also standalone 
28 -The preferrred choice for working with build tools like Jenkins or Cruise Control 
29 
 
30 
 
31 Ant 
32 --- 
33 -Ant was developed to be a replacement for a build tool called "Make" 
34 -Designed to be cross platform 
-Built on top of Java and XML 
36 -Very procedural 
37 
 
38 Ant vs Maven 
39 ------------ 
40 -Ant really isn't build tool as much as it is a scripting tool 
41 -You have to explicitly do everything in Ant 
42 
 
43   <target name="clean" description="clean up"> 
44     <!-- Delete the ${build} and ${dist} directory trees --> 
45     <delete dir="${build}" /> 
46   </target> 
47 -We have to define everything that we want to do 
48  clean,clear,cleanup etc.. 
49 -A lot of tribal knowledge nothing carries over 
50 
 
51 Maven : 
52 ------- 
53 -Maven is a full fledged build tool 
54 -A lot of implicit functionality 
55 -Consistency across projects 
56 -Also capable to achieve inheritance in projects 
57 -Transitive dependencies (can be achieved using Ivy with Ant though) 
58 -Build around versioning 
59 
 
60 Ant vs Maven summary 
61 -------------------- 
62 -Ant is very declarative 
63 -Maven follows a convention over configuration model 
64 -Ant is may be easier to learn but it really is only beneficial as a scripting tool 
65 -Maven is really centered around managing your entire project's lifecycle 
66 
 
67 
 
68 file name must be pom.xml 
69 POM - Project Object Model 
70 -------------------------- 
71 
 
72 <project> 
73     <groupId>com.pluralsight</groupId> ------------company name web address 
74     <artifactId>HelloWorld</aritifactId> 
75     <version>1.0-SNAPSHOT </version>------------------SNAPSHOT must be in capital letter 
76     <moduleVersion>4.0.0</modelVersion> 
77     <packaging>jar</packaging> 
78 </project> 
79 
 
80 
 
81 Maven is expecting standard folder structure  
82 HelloWorld 
83  -src 
84     main 
85       java 
86         HelloWorld.java 
87  -target 
88  -pom.xml 
89 
 
90 
 
91 target 
92 ------ 
93 -where everything gets compiled to 
94 -Also where tests get ran from 
95 -Contents in this directory get packaged into a jar,war,ear etc. 
96 
 
97 pom.xml 
98 ------- 
99 can be divided into 4 basic parts : 
100 -Project Information 
101  groupId----------package name 
102  artifactId-------application name 
103  version 
104  packaging-------jar war ear.. 
105 -Dependencies 
106  Direct dependencies used in our application 
107 -Build 
108  Plugins 
109  Directory Structure 
110 -Repositories 
111  Referring to central or any shared repository 
112 
 
113 Dependencies 
114 ------------ 
115 -What we want to use in our application 
116 -Dependencies are imported by their naming convention 
117  Often considered the most confusing part of Maven 
118 -We have to know the groupId,artifactId and the version of what we are looking for 
119 -Added to a dependencies section to our pom file 
120 
 
121 -Just list the dependency that we want 
122  Transitive dependencies will be pulled in by Maven 
123 -Need at a minimum 3 things 
124  groupId 
125  artifactId 
126  version 
<dependencies> 
129        <dependency> 
130          <groupId>commons-lang</groupId> 
131          <artifactId>commons-lang</artifactId> 
132          <version>2.1</version> 
133        <dependency> 
134     </dependencies> 
135 
 
136 Goals 
137 ----- 
138 -clean 
139  Deletes the target directory and any generated resources 
140 
 
141 -compile 
142  compiles all source code, generates any files, copies resources to our classes directory 
143 
 
144 -package 
145  Runs the compile command first, runs any tests, packages the app based off its packaging type 
146 
 
147 -install 
148  Runs the package command and then installs it in your local repo 
149 
 
150 -deploy 
151  Runs the install command and then deploys it to a corporate repository 
152  often confused with web server deployment 
153 
 
154 
 
155 Local Repository 
156 ---------------- 
157 -Where Maven stores everything it downloads 
158  Installs in your home directory\.m2 
159 -Stores artifacts using the information that you provided for artifactId, groupId and version 
160   e.g. 
161   C:\Users\sdegaonk\.m2\repository\junit\junit\3.8.1\junit-3.8.1.jar 
162 -Avoids duplication by copying it in every project and storing it in your SCM 
163 
 
164 Defaults 
165 -------- 
166 These are all the defaults that Maven has, but how do we override them? 
167 -The build section! 
168 
 
169 e.g. in pom.xml 
170      <build> 
171        <finalName>foo</finalName> 
172      </build> 
173 
 
174 
 
175 
 
176 
 
177 Versions: 
178 -------- 
179 Version numbers are up to your corporate strategy 
180 SNAPSHOT : download latest version 
181 -Development starts off as a SNAPSHOT 
182  myapp-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar 
183  Changes always downloaded 
184  Saves you from rereleasing versions for development 
185  Never deploy to production with a SNAPSHOT 
186 -A release doesn't have a specific naming convention 
187  myapp-1.0.jar 
188  myapp-1.0.1.jar 
189 -Industry common terms, but don't affect maven 
190  myapp-1.0-M1.jar(milestone release) 
191  myapp-1.0-RC1.jar(release candidate) 
192  myapp-1.0-RELEASE.jar(release) 
193  myapp-1.0-Final.jar(release) 
194 
 
195 Types 
Current core packaging types are: 
198 -pom,jar,maven-plugin,ejb,war,ear,rar,par 
199 -The default packaging type is jar 
200 The type of pom is referred to as a dependency pom 
201 -Downloads dependencies from that pom 
202 
 
203 
 
204 <project> 
205     <groupId>com.pluralsight</groupId> ------------company name web address 
206     <artifactId>HelloWorld</aritifactId> 
207     <version>1.0-SNAPSHOT </version>------------------SNAPSHOT must be in capital letter 
208     <moduleVersion>4.0.0</modelVersion> 
209     <packaging>jar</packaging>--------------------jar,war,rar,par.. 
210 </project> 
211 
 
212 
 
213 Transitive Dependencies 
214 ----------------------- 
215 -The main reason people begin using maven 
216  e.g. 
217   If we add a dependency: 
218   <dependency> 
219     <groupId>org.hibernate</groupId> 
220     <artifactId>hibernate-core</artifactId> 
221     <version>4.1.6.Final</version> 
222     <scope>compile</scope> 
223   </dependency> 
224 If we add a dependency it downloads it's transitive dependencies : 
225    antrl 
226    dom4j 
227    hibernate-commons-annotations 
228    hibernate-core 
229    hibernate-jpa 
230    javassist 
231    jboss-logging 
232    jboss-transaction-api_1.1_spec 
233 
 
234 junit has hamcrest.jar dependency 
235 
 
236 Scope 
237 ----- 
238 There are 6 scopes available for dependencies: 
239 -compile - default scope, artifacts available everywhere 
240 -provided - like compile, means that the artifact is going to be provided where it is deployed 
241  servlet-api.jar 
242  xml-apis 
243  Available in all phases, but not included in final artifact 
244 -runtime - not needed for compilation, but needed for execution 
245  e.g. jdbc jar 
246 -test - only available for the test compilation and execution phase 
247 -system - similar to provided, you specify a path to the jar on your file system 
248  Very brittle and defeats the purpose of maven, don't use! 
249 -import - advanced topic, deals with dependencyManagement sections 
250 
 
251 
 
252 
 
253 Repositories: 
254 ------------- 
255 -simply just a http accessible location that you download files from  
256 -Default location 
257  http://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2 
258 -Multiple repositories allowed 
259 -Corporate Repository 
260  Nexus(this is what the default repo is built  
 Artifactory 
262 
 
263 Dependency Repository 
264 --------------------- 
265 -Where we download all of our dependencies from 
266  can contain just releases and/or snapshots 
267  Not uncommon to have them in separate repositories 
268 
 
269 -How do we specify our own repository 
270   
271  <repositories> 
272     <repository> 
273        <id>spring-snapshot</id> 
274        <name>Spring Maven SNAPSHOT Repository</name> 
275        <url>http://repo.springsource.org/libs-snapshot</url> 
276       <snapshots> 
277          <enabled>true</enabled> 
278       </snapshots> 
279       <releases> 
280         <enabled>false</enabled> 
281       </releases> 
282    </repository> 
283  </repositories> 
284 
 
285 Plugin Repository : 
286 ------------------- 
287 -Identical to Dependency Repositories, just deals with Plugins 
288 -Will only look for Plugins, by design usually a separate repository 
289 
 
290   <pluginRepositories> 
291     <pluginRepository> 
292       <id>acme core</id> 
293       <name>Acme Internal Corporate Repository</name> 
294       <url>http://acmecorp.com/plugins</url> 
295       <snapshots> 
296         <enabled>true</enabled> 
297       </snapshots> 
298       <releases> 
299           <enabled>true</enabled> 
300       </releases> 
301     </pluginRepository> 
302    </pluginRepositories> 
303 
 
304 
 
305 
 
306 
 
307 Releases / Snapshots 
308 
 
309 -Snapshots and releases can come from the same repo 
310 
 
311 -Why would projects not upload everything to the central repo 
312  Snapshots 
 Milestones 
314  Release Candidate 
315  Release policies 
316 
 
317 Summary : 
318 --------- 
319 -Dependency repositories and Plugin repositories can be separte or the same repository 
320 -Projects will often not upload their SNAPSHOT code up to the central repo even though 
321  their release project is hosted there 
322 -Plugins are usually in the same repo as dependencies 
323 -Companies should use a corporate repository internally to help lighten the load on 
324  the central repo 
325 
 
326 Maven plugins 
327 -------------- 
328 -------------- 
329 
 
330 -Plugins are tied to one of the defined phases, but can usually be overridden 
331 -The complile plugin is already defined for you, but is often changed to use a specific version of Java. 
332 -The jar plugin is one of the default plugins and can be configured to produce artifacts to specific needs. 
333 -Source and Javadocs can easily be generated to be installed in your coporate repository for use by other developers. 
334
